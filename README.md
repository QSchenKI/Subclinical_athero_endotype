# Subclinical_athero_endotype
Subclinical atherosclerosis endotype prediction
The predicition model will be released and public avaliable for the academic purpose.

## Conda installation and enviroment set-up
Please check the following link for conda installation> https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html
                
After conda installation, please search the "endotype_pred.yml" in the folder of env for enviroment set/up, with the following script in terminal>
```
conda create env --file env/endotype_pred.yml
```

## data preparation for endotype prediction in your cohort
Please organize your data with the following order (by columns):

For the OLINK protein, please use the Z-scores in your own cohort.
Save the dataset as csv file, with sep of ",".

## endotype prediction
Supposed we save the data for prediction in folder of data, then the endotype can be predicted as follow
```
python endotype_pred.py --file data/exmaple_data.csv --output output.csv
```
After running this command, the file output.csv will include a new column of pred_endotype indicating the predicted endotype in your cohort.
You can specify the directory of input file by --file or -f, and specify the output file directory and name by --output or -o
